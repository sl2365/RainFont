# RainFont x64
## Description by JSMorley:

RainFont will scan all your TrueType fonts installed in Windows, and when you click on one will provide important information, especially the all-important FontFace=xxxx settting you need to use in meters in your skins. Remember, Rainmeter wants the "Family Name" of the font, not the "Font Name" displayed in Windows. RainFont will find and provide the correct Family Name to use in FontFace=.

Some fonts will not work properly in Rainmeter if they have internal attributes of BOLD/ITALIC/BOLD ITALIC and you don't put the appropriate StringStyle=xxxx setting in the meter as well. RainFont will provide this information if needed.

You can also use TrueType fonts on your hard drive, not installed in Windows. Simply save the font in an @Resources\Fonts folder in the root config of your skin. Use the "Browse" button to find a font you have saved, to give you all the same information you need to use an uninstalled font stored with your skin.

## Changelog:

- Added buttons at the top for changing the view and selecting and saving the Rainmeter Skins folder path.
